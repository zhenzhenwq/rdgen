# New Window Handoff

This is the current durable handoff for the RustDesk generator work.

## Workspace And Safety

- Main repository: `D:\rustdesk-生成器\rdgen`
- Branch: `master`
- User fork/build repository: `https://github.com/zhenzhenwq/rdgen.git`
- Upstream: `https://github.com/bryangerlach/rdgen.git`
- Deployed generator: `https://120.55.0.199/`
- Host-purpose boundary: `120.55.0.199` remains the generator production host. A root audit on 2026-08-10 found no pre-existing RustDesk server; afterward, the user explicitly approved one isolated temporary multi-relay test. Its exact footprint is `/opt/rdgen-relay-test`, user `rdgen-relay-test`, and the three `rdgen-relay-test-*` transient systemd units. Do not expand it into a production server without fresh approval.
- Old reference project: `D:\rustdesk_web客户端\rdgen-repo`

The old reference project is strictly read-only. Do not edit, format, move, delete, clean, or generate files inside it.

Do not write server passwords, GitHub tokens, signing passwords, private certificate material, Django secrets, or API bearer tokens into repository files or answers. Code-signing material under `D:\rustdesk-生成器\codesign\` is sensitive and outside this repository.

Do not submit the live generator form unless the user explicitly asks. A push to `master` automatically starts the repository's Docker image workflow, but it does not dispatch a RustDesk client generation workflow.

The full generator path requires public GitHub Actions callbacks. Local Docker cannot provide meaningful end-to-end generation coverage and is not a release prerequisite; use local services only for UI/form inspection unless the user explicitly requests local container work.

## Latest Operational Checkpoint (2026-08-20 19:47 +08)

- The latest generator application commit is `34e6e23`; `master` also contains the current durable handoff. Push-triggered Docker runs `32362878501` and `32365731821` reached GitHub successfully and failed only at `Login to Docker Hub`; no client workflow was dispatched. The public production generator still redirects to its healthy login page and remains on application commit `d4ec7e4`. The supplied root password is accepted by the lab VM but was rejected by `120.55.0.199`, and this workstation has no SSH key for that host. Do not claim that `fd13daf..34e6e23` is deployed until host access or the registry credential is repaired and the live tree is verified.
- Server integration is at local commit `03792f3`. That commit pins `migrations/smart_relay/*.sql` to LF after a Rocky build from the Windows bind mount embedded CRLF SQLx checksums and correctly refused the existing LF-created database. All ten durable migration checksums were matched offline before the corrected build was installed. The active VM hbbs SHA-256 is `fe90e42f6aafca5971f14683cc0cd5f413d08a9714d7977fb27fd5484986e9f3`.
- The authoritative VM node `35255ea8-658d-4d46-8e98-8fbeac4ce769` retains its original generation-1 credential. Never re-enroll it. The controller DB, credential key, and agent key were backed up before the upgrade; the main rollback archive is `/opt/rdsmart-slice/backups/pre-9ddf237-20260820T112143Z.tar.gz`, mode `0600`, SHA-256 `b9cc10e82534fe0b37d8442ba0e7d7ef01ce93c6866e4a314ff9eab5ac750f1d`.
- The VM now has distinct no-login `rdsmart-agent` UID 979 and `rdsmart-relay` UID 980 accounts with IPC GID 980. `rdsmart-hbbr-supervisor.service` and `rdsmart-agent.service` are enabled and active. The supervisor owns the official hbbr child, `/run/rdsmart-hbbr-supervisor/control.sock` is `0660 rdsmart-relay:rdsmart-ipc`, and the durable supervisor state is `0600` at revision 2/mode active. A real stop/reap/socket-delete/port-close/rebind/restart gate passed.
- The bounded gate ran twice with `--max-applied 2`: revision 1 applied `draining`, revision 2 applied `active`, both services exited 0, and the offline agent journal moved from accepted sequence 8 to 12 with `next_report_sequence=13`, `applied_revision=desired_revision=2`, no pending report, and safety `normal`. The permanent agent then started and a systemd restart preserved fresh telemetry. Local TCP connect to `1.1.1.1:24117` passed, but this is a VM-local `/32` lab alias routed through `lo`; it is not proof of external ownership or client reachability.
- The controller remains an explicitly temporary root-run process rather than the gated non-root controller systemd candidate. The host's NSS configuration includes `sss`, so the strict packaging validator intentionally rejects it, and the frozen local-admin socket ownership conflict is still unresolved. Do not turn this lab slice into a production packaging claim. Firewalld was not expanded because `1.1.1.1` is only a local collision-prone test alias.
- VM upload staging, the invalid CRLF release, and the expired enrollment artifact were removed after the verified backup. The retired v1 run config was preserved as `/opt/rdsmart-slice/run.v1-retired-20260820.json`. Local default/rocky targets remain absent; two release builds each cleaned about 1.4 GiB of container target data, and three unused Docker images were removed. The only retained local release is `D:\rustdesk-生成器\vm-xfer\release-03792f3-rocky8-deploy` (about 22 MiB).
- Remaining release blockers are: restore generator production access or registry delivery, deploy and verify `34e6e23`, dispatch and pass the four smart Windows x64/x86/Linux/Android workflows, and execute a real domain/certificate-backed strict-WSS requester/target vertical slice. The current IP-only lab topology and S1-S3 fixtures do not satisfy that client release gate.

## Upstream RustDesk Source References

### Client

- Clean current-source directory: `D:\rustdesk-生成器\rustdesk-src`.
- Official remote: `https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk.git`; branch `upstream-master` tracks `origin/master`.
- Verified against the official remote HEAD on 2026-08-09 at `11190fa54e45fd244ad46b46052f92be6a01d3c5`, committed 2026-08-08 09:33:58 +0800 with subject `docs: fix comma splice gui tutorial in README.md (#15787)`.
- Latest stable tag observed is `1.4.9` at `6c578292e8ebbbec708b76986ba8c4bc7c509747`. The current master manifests declare `1.4.9` / Flutter `1.4.9+67`.
- `libs/hbb_common` is initialized at `69cea8dafee147848ae88702029f4bf7df7224c3`. The clone is shallow and partial but the current source working tree is complete and clean; fetch additional history on demand.
- Use this directory for later questions about the latest official client. Do not confuse it with the dirty, preserved patch-test directories `rustdesk-src-147-inspect` and `rustdesk-src-149-inspect`, and do not edit any of the three without a user-requested source change.

### OSS Server

- Clean current-source directory: `D:\rustdesk-生成器\rustdesk-server-src`.
- Official remote: `https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk-server.git`; local `master` tracks `origin/master`.
- Verified against official remote HEAD on 2026-08-09 at `a7736be5e40f85bfc141120dce587e836e5d4b80`, committed 2026-08-07 16:56:36 +0800 with subject `Delete .github/dependabot.yml`.
- Latest stable tag observed is `1.1.16` at `73523b31cfd25d77dee862e6fc9f5e1fb5e485ef`; current master declares development version `1.1.17`.
- `libs/hbb_common` is initialized at `69cea8dafee147848ae88702029f4bf7df7224c3`. The shallow/partial clone has a complete and clean current worktree containing the `hbbs`, `hbbr`, Docker, systemd, Debian, and Kubernetes sources.
- Use this directory for later questions about the official OSS rendezvous/relay server. Read its repository-local `AGENTS.md` before editing and keep it unchanged unless the user requests a source modification.

## Frozen Phase-two Smart Multi-relay Design

- `MULTI_RELAY_PHASE2_DECISIONS.md` contains decisions 0-44. Product discovery is complete and there is no pending first-release question.
- `MULTI_RELAY_PHASE2_SPEC.md` is the frozen first-release engineering contract. Protocol, scheduler/accounting, and operations/security terminal reviews found no remaining P0/P1 conflict.
- Exact implementation baselines are client `1.4.9` (`6c578292...`, hbb `7e1c392c...`) and server `1.1.16` (`73523b31...`, hbb `83419b65...`). The clean source-reference directories remain read-only; implementation requires separate writable worktrees.
- Planned components are custom hbbs/controller, unchanged official hbbr, one outbound-HTTPS relay agent, local CLI, and smart client patches for Windows x64/x86, Linux, and Android. The first release is IPv4-only, one controller, and at most 50 relays; macOS/API/Web UI/notifications/upgrades/runtime licensing/HA are deferred.
- Scheduling uses two-peer RTT sum with a per-leg guardrail plus bandwidth, utilization, metered quota, maintenance, and host-safety policy. Client probing is bounded to six candidates. Missing monitoring falls back to compatible official TCP-health selection while explicit admin policy and confirmed quota exhaustion remain authoritative.
- Every smart `RequestRelay` retry generates a new UUID as upstream does, but reuses one server-signed selection and endpoint. This is the frozen compatibility rule for both smart and old target clients.
- Decision 44 preserves upstream PeerMap's existing registration-security IP storage; all newly added smart measurement/session data obeys the stricter non-persistence boundary.
- Phase-two implementation now exists only in isolated writable worktrees. The first real local-process S1 integration passed on 2026-08-13 with server `f8d1766a9b4393cf179dda976103cde8f26799a7` (tree `493565835e617b2353441e3ce9f8c6ec0d02d6c4`), client `2441b53d5667050cc6fe80c1428f18e178311346`, and client `hbb_common` `b3183ee848c1566e59737e878a418bbb177dc2bc`.
- S1 attempt UUID `91a64b5d-dec0-4d90-9782-2e0d2a2b883d` completed in 8.3 seconds. Selected R2 recorded one new request and one pair; non-selected R1 recorded neither (`R2 1/1`, `R1 0/0`). The fixture crossed real local hbbs, two hbbr processes, target B, and requester A.
- The LAN endpoint allowance, rendezvous key-exchange helper, and metrics-availability bridge are feature-only S1 test support. They are not production behavior and do not establish a production raw-TCP smart closed loop; production validation should prefer strict WSS.
- The same-UUID S2 local milestone passed with server `fa464c262fd3401a6db87dcbe74e7fe3991e0c1b` (tree `0bbf9db7ea43aa1be4986f3963bcc743ec18499b`), client parent `0b997fea0caa69cd4f69d3cfcd6a681d3b7e8992`, and client `hbb_common` `b3183ee848c1566e59737e878a418bbb177dc2bc`. UUID `0737e04a-77f4-4a84-8bfc-8f0019492b9f` completed in about 9.18 seconds, below the 30-second limit.
- All three same-UUID lanes produced decrypted protobuf frames with SHA-256 `b362d0f9fe11d8a84fe96243e80ab130d1b81b3b92a0214c35b53d987689e3aa`. hbbs recorded owner/enqueue/join/replay once each; B create/pairing and A hbbr owner/pairing each occurred once; selected R2 was `1/1`, and R1 was `0/0`.
- S1/S2 contract, dry-run, and offline checks passed, and test worktrees/processes were cleaned.
- The different-UUID S3 final local milestone passed with server HEAD `d34bcaec3b86d89614037df03dffcff43d01ee4f` (tree `a2173c417b968a7dda45e8c1ba2dd230d16d36e7`), client `051a54c23a55c5c76272a09c3b9de0557088a80a`, and client `hbb_common` `b3183ee848c1566e59737e878a418bbb177dc2bc`. UUID1 `68c25b4d-f9de-4a4b-a66d-2098b924ec5f` and UUID2 `25075eb6-fefd-447c-8bfd-507ec3ad2c37` produced response SHA-256 values `fbb650ead7c078533bbc1ad7c5e0a6197512d6ff684c6d7cc772413326e0790` and `12dd0e3fea68f17a045fe97dc12d4fdcab3cc927f819ecdadd8ac5dbc8e34ef1`, respectively. The recovery interval was 5 ms and total duration was 7,563 ms.
- For each S3 UUID, hbbs owner/enqueue/join/replay was `1/1/0/0`, and B create/pairing was `1/1`. A was `0/0` for UUID1 and `1/1` for UUID2; R1 stayed `0/0` for both UUIDs, while R2 was `1/0` for UUID1 and `1/1` for UUID2.
- S1/S2/S3 contract checks and locked server/client offline checks passed. The database was restored, and remaining processes and owned run roots were both zero. Those milestones remain fixture evidence rather than a production strict-WSS proof.
- Total integration closeout has since advanced substantially. Server branch `rdsmart/phase2-integration-116` is at local commit `03792f3` after `248cacb` (separate relay-supervisor UID/IPC composition), `a4e2f0c` (audited drain/force-offline/resume convergence), `9ddf237` (strict read-only `node list`), and the LF migration build lock. Rocky 8 release builds and focused Linux tests pass. The full 684-test Linux library run previously reported 649 passes and 35 environment/security-fixture failures; the affected integration, protocol, local-admin, CLI, supervisor, and packaging gates are green, but the full suite must not be described as green.
- Generator commits `fd13daf`, `c99801e`, and `ab1497e` add the off-by-default `smartMultiRelay` form/history/migration path, exact 1.4.9 and strict-WSS validation, true-only application in Windows x64/x86, Linux, and Android workflows, locked root plus `hbb_common` production patches, fixture exclusion, reason-code compatibility fallback, and network/lifecycle invalidation. `ab1497e` fixes the lifecycle bridge to reuse official `mainCheckConnectStatus`; a new FFI method would have been absent from the bridge artifact generated before smart patch application. On 2026-08-20, all 200 Django tests, system checks, migration-drift checks, three workflow tests, `actionlint`, and the complete offline apply/disable/wrong-baseline smoke contract passed. Commits through `34e6e23` are pushed, but the Docker image run failed at the existing Docker Hub login gate and no smart client workflow or artifact exists yet.
- The VM node is already enrolled with credential generation 1 and must not be re-enrolled. Its controller DB is authoritative. The corrected controller, separate supervisor, official hbbr child, and permanent agent now run the verified revision-2 active state with fresh telemetry. This completes the local server/agent vertical slice, not a production endpoint or strict-WSS client proof; retain the packaging, external-address, generator-deployment, and four-platform gates above.

## Current Release Batch

The active batch adapts the generator to RustDesk `1.4.9` while retaining `1.4.7` and `1.4.8` compatibility for strict optional patches.

The batch includes:

- RustDesk `1.4.9` as the form and workflow default.
- Windows x64, Windows x86, Linux, macOS, and Android patch-chain compatibility.
- Strict patch failures instead of `continue-on-error` for selected customizations.
- Version/platform capability checks in Django and matching dynamic UI visibility.
- Hidden-connection-window capability is separate from its default state. New forms keep the settings entry available, legacy POSTs retain their old default-on meaning, and Windows x86 exposes the same user toggle through Sciter. Flutter and Sciter write explicit `Y`/`N` overrides so users can disable a build default even when the app name remains `RustDesk`.
- Safer build inputs, manual settings, portable artifact names, Windows reserved-name checks, and bounded name lengths.
- Linux native packages, AppImage, and Flatpak customization and upload reliability fixes.
- Beijing Linux customization is accepted only for the verified `1.4.7`, `1.4.8`, and `1.4.9` tags; the UI and Django validation both enforce this boundary.
- macOS NASM `2.16.03`, packaged custom config, whole-bundle P12 signing, verification, and ad-hoc fallback signing.
- Android universal plus split APK output retained and hardened.
- Strict HTTP failure handling for generator/API uploads and external Windows signing requests.
- Shared Actions/cache/reusable-workflow cleanup.

Eleven new patch and test files belong to the batch and must never be omitted from its commit:

- `.github/patches/android_custom_config.py`
- `.github/patches/apply_linux_base_fixes.py`
- `.github/patches/customize_appimage_recipe.py`
- `.github/patches/customize_flatpak_manifest.py`
- `.github/patches/customize_linux_native_packages.py`
- `.github/patches/delay_fix.py`
- `.github/patches/hide_settings_menu.py`
- `.github/patches/rustdesk_default_linux_149.diff`
- `.github/patches/smoke_149_patch_chain.py`
- `.github/patches/test_linux_packaging_customization.py`
- `.github/patches/validate_customization.py`

Runtime patch helpers are downloaded from the current `${{ github.sha }}`; the smoke and packaging test scripts are local verification tools. Keep all eleven files in the same release commit so the implementation and its repeatable checks remain complete.

## Repository State

- Development baseline: `8ff0593`, which matched `origin/master` when this batch resumed.
- Core release commit: `8e33770` (`Adapt generator for RustDesk 1.4.9`).
- First capability-state follow-up: `cd2c358` (`Decouple hide window capability from default state`).
- Compatibility follow-up: `23d1cf3` (`Fix hide window capability compatibility`).
- Auth and task-security release: `13408fb` (`Add authenticated user management`, tree `c1b8bd7ed1dd30209a13f6e59fbf42297aaf3056`).
- Current deployed application release: `d4ec7e498a60f0996b9b10372b8ac0d1b365d10c` (`Support server-managed relay selection`, tree `eba9444758cb4b1bc82fc5aef29c269633a4497e`). It retains the full-width management workspace and adds an advanced fixed-relay field while making hbbs-selected relay the default.
- The live application is built from `d4ec7e4`. Documentation-only commits after that application commit do not change the server image. Push-triggered Docker run `31349924535` stopped at the known Docker Hub login step and did not dispatch a RustDesk client workflow.
- Treat the latest `master` commit containing this handoff as the authoritative batch state.
- The latest documentation state also includes the frozen phase-two decision/specification files; it does not change the live `d4ec7e4` application image.

## Verified State

- The optional patch chains for Windows, Windows x86, Linux, macOS, and Android were each run twice against RustDesk `1.4.7`, `1.4.8`, and `1.4.9` sources.
- Linux AppImage, Flatpak, RPM, SUSE, Arch, URI-scheme, service-config, and DEB purge customizations passed repeatability checks against real RustDesk `1.4.7`, `1.4.8`, and `1.4.9` file layouts.
- Django: 38 tests pass; system checks report no issues. Coverage includes new-form unchecked semantics, legacy POST migration, unknown schema handling, and settings-entry requirements for both hidden-window default states.
- Windows x86 patch chains ran twice on real RustDesk `1.4.7`, `1.4.8`, and `1.4.9` sources after adding the Sciter `allow-hide-cm` control.
- Linux packaging customization: 20 focused regression tests pass. They cover Python 3.6 compatibility in the Ubuntu 18.04 native container, exact `rustdesk` name handling, RPM metadata rejection, AppImage YAML quoting, Flatpak identity/metainfo/device permissions, URI protocol consistency, runtime configuration paths, udev migration, and repeatability.
- `actionlint`: no findings.
- Python AST and workflow YAML parsing: pass.
- Workflow patch references: no missing concrete files.
- Every workflow curl POST now uses HTTP failure detection.
- `git diff --check`: no whitespace errors; Git only reports the repository's existing LF-to-CRLF checkout warnings.
- Playwright desktop/mobile and platform switching checks passed. A focused follow-up also verified capability-only/default-on transitions, forced password submission, and old/current JSON import behavior with no page errors.
- Screenshots: `output/playwright/resume-149-desktop.png` and `output/playwright/resume-149-mobile.png`.
- `data/` and `output/` are ignored runtime directories and must not be committed.
- Authentication and task security add Django sessions/CSRF, administrator-created accounts, strict per-user task ownership, callback bearer tokens, signed expiring downloads, and POST-only logout. Public registration now requires a short-lived, hashed email code; new accounts begin without membership.
- Staff can create, list, filter, and revoke unused hashed activation codes for one generation, 3 days, 7 days, 30 days, or lifetime. Plaintext codes are available only in the creation response, and users activate them from the generator workspace.
- Django `5.2.16`: 189 tests pass locally and in the candidate release path. Coverage includes build-history scoping, registration and activation security, entitlement, artifact delivery, relay defaults/fixed-address validation, legacy relay migration, and forged POST rejection. System checks, migration-drift checks, compile checks, `actionlint`, and `git diff --check` pass.
- Relay configuration is effective through `override-settings`, not a top-level custom JSON key. Empty override forces use of the relay chosen by hbbs even over an older local fixed relay; a nonempty override forces one hbbr. Comma-separated pools are configured on hbbs and are rejected in the client field. This behavior was source-verified for every supported client version `1.3.3` through `1.4.9`.
- The exact generated `RelayPoolTest` client completed real two-device runtime validation. Sessions were observed on both A and B. With two live connections on A, relay A was stopped at 11:46:42; hbbs removed it, and both clients re-paired through B at 11:47:00, about 18 seconds later. A was restored at 11:47:09, both relays returned to the healthy pool, and the generator remained healthy with zero restarts.
- Entitlement UI screenshots passed at 1440px desktop, 900px tablet, and 390px mobile with no page-level horizontal overflow or overlap. Desktop uses the sidebar account area; narrower layouts use a navigation-under status strip with two-column mobile metrics.
- Desktop, 768px tablet, and 390px mobile layouts passed Playwright checks across Windows, Windows x86, Android, standard/custom Linux, and macOS visibility states. Imported PNG previews now use strict base64 validation plus DOM node creation; a malicious JSON import was verified not to execute while valid PNG previews still render.
- The live generator was deployed from tree `eba9444758cb4b1bc82fc5aef29c269633a4497e`. Windows x64 task success still requires exact persisted `.exe` and `.msi` receipts whose size and SHA-256 match the final files; uploads are staged and atomically committed, retries cannot replace immutable content, and terminal status callbacks cannot revive or bypass finalization.
- The generator, account, waiting, generated, and failure templates no longer load Font Awesome from Cloudflare. `local_icons.html` embeds a minimal Font Awesome 6.4.0 WOFF2 subset and three generated transparent PNG masks. All 43 glyph mappings, conditional entitlement/user/download icons, the JavaScript copy/check transition, desktop and 390x844 mobile layouts were visually verified without missing-glyph boxes, horizontal overflow, or Font Awesome CDN requests.
- macOS validation run `29975374837` succeeded on real GitHub-hosted macOS runners for both `x86_64` and `aarch64`. Each matrix job passed customization validation, RustDesk compilation, embedded configuration packaging, ad-hoc signing, bundle metadata and architecture checks, DMG creation, `hdiutil verify`, and artifact upload. The outputs are two architecture-specific DMGs, not one Universal image; validation mode skipped all production callbacks. Local copies are under `output/macos-validation-29975374837`; SHA-256 is `25151cb4d1349fa2055f98393547174c05c7f536bb391d4ba962e072333e234e` for x86_64 and `849022e5ca9a84b24cbb7ef233cbb253e0fee8e24a3d1b05b85d18207662eb67` for aarch64.

Important Linux/Flatpak boundaries:

- The native package helper rejects RPM macro characters and whitespace-invalid RPM URLs, avoids same-file `mv` failures for the exact `rustdesk` name, and keeps binary/service names separate from visible app/company metadata.
- Linux deep links use a stable `rdgen-<filename hex>` URI scheme in both Rust runtime code and the desktop handler. Service config copying and DEB purge cleanup follow `directories-next` whitespace/lowercase behavior and shell-quote cleanup paths.
- Uinput rules use `0660` plus `uaccess`; install/upgrade hooks reload and trigger udev, and legacy `chmod 0666 /dev/uinput` blocks are removed.
- Flatpak uses a case-preserving hex-derived `com.rdgen.app_<hex>` ID and keeps manifest ID, desktop rename, metainfo component/launchable, and `build-bundle` ref synchronized. `--device=dri` remains and `--device=all` is removed.
- Consequently, Flatpak must not be advertised as supporting `/dev/uinput`-based unattended Wayland input. X11 remains the expected path; a real X11/Wayland portal smoke test is still required before making a stronger runtime claim.

## Live Deployment

- URL: `https://120.55.0.199/` (`http://120.55.0.199/` redirects to HTTPS; public port 8000 is closed).
- Application source commit: `d4ec7e498a60f0996b9b10372b8ac0d1b365d10c`; application tree: `eba9444758cb4b1bc82fc5aef29c269633a4497e`.
- Deployment ID: `20260810-103245-d4ec7e498a60`.
- Source archive SHA-256: `b5b2ff4cfa00ffcac5c9668618a71e6a0541d6c781fd2c9b89ea330e7bf577bb`.
- Live image: `sha256:d2358abecb4c7bf741e4a96d90bc766c9ad70e876fa27cfc78e29bee71c147c7`.
- Live container is `rdgen-rdgen-1`, verified `running`, `healthy`, restart count `0`, with zero post-deploy traceback/critical/worker-timeout fingerprints. Online RequestFactory checks confirmed full-width rendering for build records, user management, and activation-code management, while build-record member scoping still passes. Public registration, email verification, membership activation, entitlement, platform validation, and administrator-unlimited behavior remain intact.
- Nginx terminates TLS and rate-limits `/login/`; the container binds only `127.0.0.1:8000`. The trusted Let's Encrypt IP certificate is renewed by the enabled `rdgen-certbot-renew.timer`; staging renewal passed.
- The production `admin` superuser exists. Never add its password to Git, memory files, shell history, or chat summaries.
- Persistent `.env`, `data`, `exe`, `png`, `temp_zips`, and SQLite inodes were preserved. `.env` remains mode `600`; migrations `0008_activationcode` and `0009_registrationemailcode` are applied, and SQLite `quick_check` passes with 4 users and 40 task rows after the authorized relay build.
- Production uses QQ SMTP over SSL on port 465. The live container authenticated successfully without sending a post-deploy message; the mailbox and authorization value are secrets and must never be copied into Git, memory files, commands that print them, or answers.
- Account expiry now supports permanent/time-based and successful-package-count policies. Download delivery supports creator/admin login or public token access with 1-hour, 1-day, 3-day, or 7-day expiry beginning at the first valid installer upload. Quota reservation creation and artifact settlement are atomic and guard administrative mode changes.
- `/etc/cron.d/rdgen-cleanup` runs hourly with `flock`. Initial enforcement removed 13 expired secret ZIPs and one empty directory, no installer and no reservation; the immediate post-run dry-run reported zero pending removals.
- Root-only rollback material is under `/opt/rdgen-backups/20260810-103245-d4ec7e498a60`, `/opt/rdgen-previous-20260810-103245-d4ec7e498a60`, and `rdgen-rollback:20260810-103245-d4ec7e498a60`. The backup contains online/final SQLite snapshots plus the prior environment, Nginx configuration, source, build/test logs, and image metadata. Earlier rollback sets remain present.
- The hourly cleanup converted the former cancelled legacy `in_progress` row to `timed_out`. Current database and GitHub gates report zero active client workflows.
- Deployment itself submitted no generator form. The later user-authorized `RelayPoolTest` Windows x64 build succeeded as GitHub Actions run `31350450912`; its EXE/MSI receipts, hashes, embedded configuration, real two-device relay selection, and controlled failover were independently verified.
- The pre-test host audit checked Docker, systemd, processes, packages, cron, Nginx, firewall, filesystem, and ports 21114-21119; no pre-existing RustDesk server target existed, so nothing was deleted. The later user-authorized test runs official OSS server `1.1.16` with hbbs on `120.55.0.199:22116`, relay A on `:22117`, relay B on `:23117`, and forced relay enabled. Real clients verified B/A round-robin plus automatic reconnection to B roughly eight seconds after A was stopped. A was restored; all three test units are active, both relays are healthy, and the generator remains healthy with zero restarts. The same-host topology is only a functional proof, not geographic or host-level redundancy.

## Not Yet Verified

- Public Actions history contains successful manually dispatched Windows generator runs `29318081070` at `8e33770` and `29326063260` at `cd2c358`. They were not push-triggered; their artifacts and runtime behavior have not been audited here, and the public API cannot distinguish a GitHub UI dispatch from a generator/API dispatch.
- No real Linux or Android client compilation has been verified for this batch. macOS Intel and Apple Silicon compilation is covered by run `29975374837`.
- Docker image runs, including application push run `31349924535` and subsequent documentation-only pushes, fail at `Login to Docker Hub` because repository Docker Hub credentials are unavailable. The production image was built and tested directly on the server; repair `vars.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` separately.
- macOS ad-hoc signing is verified on real runners. Production P12 signing with configured secrets, Apple notarization, and stapling remain unverified.
- No real Flatpak bundle installation/runtime smoke test has been run for this batch.
- Phase two is no longer design-only: S1/S2/S3 fixture integration, production-path client/controller/agent/supervisor code, native packaging, generator form/history/workflow wiring, and offline locked-patch application are locally verified at the scope described above. Real Windows x64/x86, Linux, and Android smart artifacts, install/runtime smoke, production strict-WSS end-to-end operation, the authorized VM vertical slice, three-region testing, the 50-node load test, push, and deployment remain unverified or undone.

## Resume Checklist

1. Run `git status --short --branch` and `git log --oneline -n 8 --decorate`.
2. Confirm the eleven new patch and test files are tracked in the release commit.
3. Re-run Django tests, `actionlint`, patch-reference checks, YAML/Python parsing, and `git diff --check` after any edit.
4. Verify remote state before pushing; the machine's global Git proxy may point at unavailable `127.0.0.1:7892`.
5. The relay-aware generator release, real Windows build, and controlled failover validation are complete. Treat additional builds, independent-host relay testing, local Docker setup, and Docker credential repair as separate follow-up work.
6. For phase two, start from generator `ab1497e` and server integration `9ddf237`; preserve the verified S1/S2/S3 evidence but keep fixture bridges out of production claims. The next release gates are real four-platform smart artifacts and install/runtime checks plus an authorized strict-WSS Linux vertical slice on an actually local endpoint. Preserve the existing VM credential/state, do not restore the stale local SQLite snapshot, do not use `1.1.1.1`, do not edit clean upstream references, and do not push, dispatch, or deploy without explicit authorization.

## Deployment Notes

The deployed host directory is `/opt/rdgen`; the Docker service is `rdgen-rdgen-1` on loopback port `8000`, behind Nginx on public ports 80/443. The host is CentOS 9 with Docker `29.6.1` and Compose `v5.2.0`; `/opt/rdgen` is a controlled source snapshot rather than a Git checkout.

For a future deployment, preserve `.env`, `exe`, `png`, `temp_zips`, and `data`. On Windows, use `git -c core.autocrlf=false archive` when byte-for-byte Git blob fidelity matters. Build and test the candidate while the old container remains live; before a schema-changing cutover, stop or block public writes, take and verify a final SQLite snapshot, recheck GitHub activity from the isolated snapshot, then switch and keep signal-aware rollback responsibility until health checks pass. Do not perform a blind destructive sync or remove current rollback material before the next deployment is verified.

Historical work, previous real Windows signing and Android universal APK verification, and RustDesk server network investigation remain documented in `WORKLOG.md`.
