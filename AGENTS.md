# Agent Notes

## Project Context

This repository is a local clone of `https://github.com/bryangerlach/rdgen`.
The working directory is `D:\rustdesk-生成器\rdgen`.

The user wants to optimize this RustDesk custom client generator. Keep changes scoped and preserve upstream behavior unless the requested optimization requires a behavior change.

## Operating Rules

- Use PowerShell commands from the repository root unless a task requires another shell.
- Prefer `rg` / `rg --files` for source discovery.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- Do not overwrite user changes. Check `git status --short` before edits.
- Avoid submitting the live generator form unless the user explicitly asks.
- Browser inspection artifacts should go under `output/playwright/`.

## Git / Network Notes

- The machine has global Git proxy configured as `http://127.0.0.1:7892` for both HTTP and HTTPS.
- That proxy was unavailable during the initial clone attempt.
- The repo was cloned successfully with temporary proxy overrides:
  `git -c http.proxy= -c https.proxy= clone --depth 1 https://github.com/bryangerlach/rdgen.git rdgen`

## Browser Notes

- The Chrome DevTools MCP connection did not work in this session even after launching Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`.
- Playwright was used as fallback through a temporary install in `%TEMP%\rdgen-pw-inspect`, using system Chrome as the executable.
- Saved screenshots currently exist in `output/playwright/`.

## Prior Project Reference

- Previous user-customized fork: `D:\rustdesk_web客户端\rdgen-repo`.
- Treat it as strictly read-only. Do not write, edit, format, move, delete, clean, or generate files inside this old project.
- Useful generic fixes may be ported, but avoid copying personal overlay behavior tied to `zhenzhen122/rustdesk`.
