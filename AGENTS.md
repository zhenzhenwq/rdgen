# Agent Notes

## Project Context

This repository is a local clone of `https://github.com/bryangerlach/rdgen`.
The working directory is `D:\rustdesk-生成器\rdgen`.

The user wants to optimize this RustDesk custom client generator. Keep changes scoped and preserve upstream behavior unless the requested optimization requires a behavior change.

## Operating Rules

- Use PowerShell commands from the repository root unless a task requires another shell.
- Prefer `rg` / `rg --files` for source discovery.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- Do not overwrite user changes. Check `git status --short` before edits.
- Avoid submitting the live generator form unless the user explicitly asks.
- Browser inspection artifacts should go under `output/playwright/`.

## Git / Network Notes

- The machine has global Git proxy configured as `http://127.0.0.1:7892` for both HTTP and HTTPS.
- That proxy was unavailable during the initial clone attempt.
- The repo was cloned successfully with temporary proxy overrides:
  `git -c http.proxy= -c https.proxy= clone --depth 1 https://github.com/bryangerlach/rdgen.git rdgen`

## Browser Notes

- The Chrome DevTools MCP connection did not work in this session even after launching Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`.
- Playwright was used as fallback through a temporary install in `%TEMP%\rdgen-pw-inspect`, using system Chrome as the executable.
- Saved screenshots currently exist in `output/playwright/`.

## Prior Project Reference

- Previous user-customized fork: `D:\rustdesk_web客户端\rdgen-repo`.
- Treat it as strictly read-only. Do not write, edit, format, move, delete, clean, or generate files inside this old project.
- Useful generic fixes may be ported, but avoid copying personal overlay behavior tied to `zhenzhen122/rustdesk`.

## Current Session Handoff Rules

- Primary working repo remains `D:\rustdesk-生成器\rdgen`.
- The current GitHub repo/fork used for builds is `https://github.com/zhenzhenwq/rdgen.git`.
- `upstream` remains `https://github.com/bryangerlach/rdgen.git`.
- Do not store plaintext server passwords, GitHub tokens, PFX passwords, or API bearer tokens in repository files.
- Credentials were provided in chat during previous work, but repository memory files intentionally omit the secret values.
- Code signing certificate material is outside the repo at `D:\rustdesk-生成器\codesign\`; treat the PFX and password file as sensitive.
- Generator server is reachable at `http://120.55.0.199:8000/`.
- The deployed generator directory on `120.55.0.199` is `/opt/rdgen`, but that server currently does not have `git` installed.
- The live Docker service is `rdgen-rdgen-1`, published on host port `8000`.
- If deploying source changes to `120.55.0.199`, do not assume `git pull` works there. Either install git deliberately, upload a controlled source snapshot, or rebuild/recreate the Docker service from a known copied tree.
- The old project `D:\rustdesk_web客户端\rdgen-repo` remains read-only even if it contains useful reference fixes.

## Current Release State

- The development baseline for the RustDesk `1.4.9` batch was `8ff0593`, matching `origin/master` when work resumed on 2026-07-13.
- The core batch was committed as `8e33770`; `cd2c358` separated hidden-window capability from its default state, and `23d1cf3` completed the compatibility follow-up. Use the latest `master` commit for subsequent fixes.
- The batch changes the form and platform workflows, ports strict optional patch chains, and hardens Linux packaging, macOS signing, uploads, and build inputs.
- Eleven new patch/test files under `.github/patches/` were tracked by the release commit; runtime workflows download patch helpers from the exact `${{ github.sha }}`.
- Public Actions history contains successful manual Windows generator runs for `8e33770` and `cd2c358`, but their artifacts were not audited here. No Linux, macOS, or Android build has been verified for this batch.
- The automatic Docker runs for `8e33770` and `cd2c358` failed before image build because Docker Hub login inputs were unavailable.
- Application source commit `23d1cf3941b2ad57a8c383af9806053884c66e2b` is deployed at `120.55.0.199:8000`; no live generator form was submitted and no client workflow was dispatched during deployment.
- A push to `master` starts `docker-build.yml`; it does not dispatch a RustDesk client generator workflow.
- Confirm the current local and remote state with `git status --short --branch`, `git log --oneline -n 8 --decorate`, and a fresh remote query before follow-up release work.

## Current Deployment State

- Deployment ID: `20260715-020154-23d1cf3941b2`.
- Verified live image: `sha256:36169d635fb2936ecf723b3076a47e4db6564d59f1197c4387ea0cb74ead561b`.
- The service was verified `running`, `healthy`, and restart count `0` from container-internal, host-loopback, server-hairpin, and independent public GET requests.
- Strong page fingerprints are hidden `formSchemaVersion=2`, `formData.settings = 'settingsY';`, and default RustDesk `1.4.9`.
- `.env`, `data`, `exe`, `png`, `temp_zips`, and SQLite inodes were preserved. `.env` hash/mode and SQLite size/integrity were unchanged.
- Keep `/opt/rdgen-backups/20260715-020154-23d1cf3941b2`, `/opt/rdgen-previous-20260715-020154-23d1cf3941b2`, and image tag `rdgen-rollback:20260715-020154-23d1cf3941b2` until a later deployment is independently verified.
